# drycleaner #laundry

You can see the use case diagram along with the modules used in the ppt attached. It is still a project in progress, so I'll be creating more forks of it in future, but as of now this is a basic and simple running project. Infact it's frontend is yet to be polished a lot so you'll need to work on that if you try to implement it.

Technologies used : 
1) Spring Boot with Gradle
2) Angular 12

The validation part of the front end is done by Vir Navalkar and Neel Dantara. I'll be adding their IDs as well soon. I'll attach the pics of the front end as well so that you can see the up and running project.
